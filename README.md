# PROJECT DUE DATE: **\[MAY 3, 2019\]**

**(2-week period) Time for completion of Project**

- Please be mindful of everyone's time constraints complete tasks in an orderly manner
  - There will need to be a sense of urgency as a complete Java "Program" 
    (Only considered a function in reality)

<br>

## Explained: Contents Provided

This README will provide a short summary for the resources I have provided and will continue to update as we begin to build out this project. The preferred way that we will be conducting this **["Development Life Cycle"](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/agile-software-development-life-cycle)** will be with an **[AGILE methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)** to promote cooperation and team communication with one another.

There will be tickets with priority levels that will need to be completed and updated to ensure we are maintaining a steady pace to the target "delivery date"

### Development LifeCycle: Brief Overview

**Why do we care about this Dev Lifecyle?**

Simply put, it helps clarify blurry details and unclear instructions/concepts. This is valuable and helps prevent anyone within the lifecycle from straying from the original gameplan. This is not hard nor complicated, but it does take a little bit of time as it helps everyone organize their thoughts as well as inquire about anything that may have misconstrusions or misguidance. There is always the discussion on how to appropriately approach an issue/obstacle. 

<br>

To provide a visual reference, we can break the lifecyle experiences down to generic steps.

1. **Planning**: Provides the team with a clear-cut direction as well as provision a plan of attack
2. **Analysis**: Closer evaluation on task priorities and what [blockers/impediments](https://www.targetprocess.com/guide/entity-types/blockers-and-impediments/) are present to provide a more deterministic timeframe of completion
3. **Design**: Implement a strategy on how to create the infrastructure and what [permissions](https://www.progress.com/documentation/sitefinity-cms/define-the-access-permissions) are and what [business logic](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/business-logic) is. These generally want to become clearly defined early on to avoid conflation and ["tech-debt" or technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt)
4. **Implementation**: Applying the designed framework/architectural components to an environment to eventually stand up for production-ready use.
5. **Testing and Integration**: Unit/Integration Testing is a must-have in most coding environments as this provides a self-check on the logic and integrated system to ensure the objectives are completed without any hiccups or major [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)
6. **Maintenance**: After tests are applied and code has been evaluated, it is generally a good practice to provide a means to alert against any error occurences or unexpected issues. These are usually seen as push-notifications to e-mails and SMS

### AGILE Methodology

<br>

[AGILE](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-concise-summary-of-Agile-and-Scrum) has become an increasingly popular team management method of use within Dev lifecycles due to the ability to flex between different aspects of a project, while no longer being tied down to particular conditions or blockers. It also encourages developers to coordinate and cooperate more frequently, which increases productivity as long as this can be done in a consistent manner.

Remember! Communication is a two-way street and cannot be a one-sided conversation. One person's pre-cognition may not align with another person's, simply due to lack of communication or mis-communication. This aspect is very key in any team environment. 

To further improve our productivity and support the work we have with organizational value, we will be introducing the [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) concept into our project. This does not have to be a daily occurrence in our specific case, but we would ideally come to the table with a brief summary of what has been completed, what needs to be completed, and what we plan to complete by **xx/xx/xxxx** date. We want to have these as much as possible to be aware of how everyone is doing, whether anyone is struggling, what we can do to soften any blows, etc. Should be communicated during our first meeting to better apply a consistent level of commitment.

- To the Scrums, in our specific situation, this does not have to be done in a traditional manner as we have many assets and tools to "re-invent" this wheel to better suit our needs. This can be discussed during our first meeting.

- To suppliment our Sprint/Lifecycle, we will also be using a ticketing system that will be need to be consistently updated to provide the team with better vision as to how much work is still necessary. To get us started, we will have a created/populated base set of tickets, which may need to be updated or further broken down. We will go over the best way to pipeline this into our work. Depending on where we stand, I might even be able to do some backend work to create some sort of trigger for you all (which would be a good way for you to see actual code in action) and then share this with you visually, but that takes some leg-work and will depend on how far you all are able to take this with little dependency and coordination levels among everyone.

## Versioning

It's a good habit to provide a version control to all code implementation and GitHub generally has a great tracking tool to do this, but without the knowledge of Command Line Interface && the GitHub commands to do so can be tricky. I am creating a manual versioning control for both teams to help keep track of progress -- this will help with any need for regression in code or restructures/comparisons

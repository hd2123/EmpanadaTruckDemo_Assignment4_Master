# JAVA FINAL ASSIGNMENT

This project will replicate a real development team. Please do not hesitate to ask any questions or vocalize concerns. This is a team and we are working towards the same goal. **_Treat this as if it were a real development environment and be inquisitive of things you don't understand._** 

If you guys need assistance, as the Solutions Architect/P.M. of the team, I will be here to assist you all the way until we complete this project and if I am unavailable, don't hesitate to reach out to a team member and ask for insight. This is a good way to also bounce ideas and provide some valuable insight to each other's logic/code.

<br>

**DISCLAIMER:**

I will only put in as much effort as you all will allow me to and guide you to the best of my knowledge. On the opposite spectrum, if you become negligent or create problems with the team, you will be called out and possibly kicked off the team and attention will be brought to Professor Jones. 

**_Please do not ruin everyone's learning experience._**

<br>

**DUE DATE: _MAY 3, 2019_**

## TEAM INFORMATION

<br>

### TEAM GOALS

Build skills and exposure that will translate to a real IT work environment. This will provide everyone with valuable experience that can be used to leverage an interview and/or provide context to what it looks like to work in a real team with a development lifecycle. I will impart and expose you guys to a lot of different things and hopefully can be a source of knowledge for any questions surrounding this context.

### TEAM MEMBER CONTACT INFORMATION

This section will allow us to maintain contact with any member of the team, in the case there is specific questions pertaining to anything project-related. I will use a querying language called **[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)** to allow you all to see another code language. 

This should be fairly clear to read, but let me know if you guys have any issues or cannot interpret the following code. If you would like to inquire more about this language, a link is provided above within the literal "JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)" word and I'll do this with all unfamiliar terms going forward to provide further elaboration, if you so choose to do further research.

JSON is used A LOT in the developer world for database queries/specific information. JSON syntax generally comprises of data nested within `{}` brackets and all descriptors/parameters are set within quotation marks (") and separated with commas (,). To provide a quick exposure of the language, it uses key-value pairs and you will notice arrays can be used to provide lists of objects as well and can get deeper in syntaxing, but we will avoid this to prevent confusion. Also note that the only objects that are allowed to sit within these JSON objects without quotes are numbers (whole and floats).

**FOR EXAMPLE:** `{"Key":{"With_Nested":"Value"}, "Another_Key":["containing","multiple","objects"]}`

### ASSIGNMENT INFORMATION

**ASSIGNMENT GOAL**: This will be discussed in our first SCRUM session (explained below) in detail.

- See `Program_Instructions.md` for detailed instructions.

**PROVIDED JAVA CLASS**: `EmpanadaTruckDemo`

<br>

### SCRUM SESSIONS

**[SCRUM SESSIONS](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-daily-scrum)** will be used to conducted to evaluate each programmer's current state, provide insight on what they are currently working on, and what they plan on working on/completing within the timeline. This will provide the team with a status update and help to answer questions or provide a concern that may be addressed. **_Each person will have a turn and summary should be no more than 5 minutes a person, totaling approximately 25 minutes_**. 

_We'll spend about **45 minutes** during these sessions to iron out details._

**Good exposure to SCRUM stand-ups are important, and may alone, land you a job. This is due to the value of these short stand-ups as they help developers stay on course, help other developers understand where the project is as a whole, and the Questions/Answers that become exposed.**

Remember, we are limited in time and will need to productive so if you are having trouble with something or do not think you will be able to finish something in time, let me and possibly a team member know and we will work with you through it. _Don't overthink something or try to over-reach with your work. **We are a team and we are here to help ease the burden!**_
